I'm a Researcher by career and education.

I'm always curious to understand the reasoning behind why things happen.

I am fascinated by the capabilities of Data Science & AI, and the potential technological advancements and transformations we can achieve through it.

With my background in Kinesiology & Biomechanics, I am also a fitness enthusiast. 

Please refer to my [portfolio] (https://ericshminn.github.io/) to view some of my projects.
