I'm a Clinical Data Coordinator by career, and a researcher by education.

I'm always curious to understand the reasoning behind why things happen.

For a long time, I was fascinated by the field of Data Science and AI and I recently studied them through self-learning and University of Toronto - Continuing Studies Data Science and Artificial Intelligence certificate programs.

With my background in Kinesiology & Biomechanics, I am also a fitness enthusiast. 

Please refer to my [portfolio] (https://ericshminn.github.io/) to view some of my projects.
